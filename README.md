Customers who haven't registered yet must do by providing the  basic information, which includes their name, address, phone number, email address etc in the frame, following that, they will receive a confirmation email.
The customer will see a frame with food items from several companies in it. By clicking on the item, they may place an order. A dialogue box with the options "ADD TO CART" and "BUY NOW" will then displayed. The customer can select one of these options, pay for it, and receive an email confirming for their transaction.
